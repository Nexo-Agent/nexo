## Step 1: Create a Workspace

A **Workspace** in Nexo is like a separate project or profile. Each workspace has its own settings, system prompts, and chat history.

1. Give your workspace a name (e.g., "Personal", "Coding", "Writing").
2. Click **Create Workspace**.

## Step 2: Configure LLM Provider

Nexo needs an "LLM Provider" to function. This is the AI brain that powers the chat.

> **What is an LLM Provider?**
> A service like OpenAI (creators of ChatGPT) or Anthropic (creators of Claude) that provides the raw intelligence. Nexo connects to these services using your API Key.

1. Navigate to **Settings** (Click the gear icon ⚙️ in the bottom left).
2. Go to **LLM Connections**.
3. Choose a provider (e.g., **OpenAI**).
4. Enter your **API Key**.
   - _Don't have a key?_ Click the link in the app to sign up for one.
5. Click **Save** and verify the connection is successful.

## Step 3: Your First Chat

Now you're ready to chat!

1. Close the settings.
2. You will see the chat interface.
3. In the text box at the bottom, type:
   > "Hello, who are you and what can you do?"
4. Press **Enter**.

The AI will respond, introducing itself. Congratulations! You've successfully set up your personal AI assistant.

## Understanding Basic Concepts

### System Prompt

The **System Prompt** allows you to define the AI's personality and behavior.

- **Default**: "You are a helpful assistant."
- **Custom**: "You are a senior JavaScript developer who prefers concise code."
  You can change this in **Workspace Settings** to tailor the AI to your specific needs.
